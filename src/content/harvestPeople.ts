/**
 * Wait for the current people-search page to render, then harvest it. Results appear a
 * few seconds AFTER the content script is ready, so a single read returns []. Poll until
 * EITHER cards render (`ok`) OR the "No results found" empty-state renders (`empty`,
 * early-exit so a genuinely-empty search stays fast). If neither shows within the budget,
 * report `not_ready` — the page never rendered (slow/failed nav), which is a DIFFERENT bug
 * from an empty search and must be reported as such. Injectable for unit tests.
 *
 * `peopleCount` (optional): count of ALL member cards on the page, connectable or not (i.e.
 * `harvestProfiles(...).length`). The action buttons hydrate a few seconds after the cards,
 * and the member componentkey lives ON the button, so `peopleCount > 0` means "buttons
 * hydrated". When the connectable `harvest()` stays empty but people ARE present, the page is
 * rendered-but-saturated (everyone already Pending) → `none_connectable`, NOT `not_ready`.
 * To avoid a false skip while cards hydrate progressively, we only conclude that once the
 * count has SETTLED (non-zero and unchanged across two polls). Smart Connect passes it;
 * Profile Views omits it (its harvest already counts all people, so `ok` fires instead).

 * Harvest across pagination (the people-search list has NO infinite scroll — you switch
 * pages). Wait+harvest each page, accumulate unique candidates (by memberId), then click
 * to the next page; stop at the target, the page cap, or when there's no next page.
 * If the FIRST page is not `ok` (empty search / never rendered) propagate that outcome
 * without paginating — there's nothing to page through, and the reason matters upstream.
 * `harvestPage`/`nextPage` are injected so the loop is unit-testable without a live DOM.
 *
 * `isFresh` (optional): when given, the target counts only FRESH candidates (e.g. profiles
 * not yet viewed). A static search returns the same faces, so without this the loop stalls
 * on page 1 once every card is already-seen; with it, it pages deeper until it has `target`
 * fresh people (or runs out of pages) — the fix for "viewed 3 of 40". Smart Connect omits it
 * (counts all), so its behaviour is unchanged.
